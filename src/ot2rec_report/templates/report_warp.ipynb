    "1. Tegunov, D., Cramer, P. Real-time cryo-electron microscopy data preprocessing with Warp. Nat Methods 16, 1146â€“1152 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0580-y\n",

    "Motion-corrected images from Ot2Rec can be imported into Warp before CTF correction to join the sub-tomogram extraction pipeline. The motion-corrected images are a special case of \"movie frames\" where there is only one movie frame - the averaged motion-corrected frames. Please ensure that motion correction is disabled in Warp if you choose this route.\n",

    "The parameters that are required are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Note on unbinned tomogram dimensions:\n",
    "- x, y dimensions determined from x- and y-dimensions of the motion corrected images\n",
    "- z dimensions determined from -VolZ flag input into AreTomo\n",
    "\n",
    "If either AreTomo or MotionCor was not used, Ot2Rec might not be able to give a full recommendation of the unbinned tomogram dimensions. You can find these dimensions manually - they should be the full unbinned x-y dimension of the images that go into Warp (usually size of the raw images) and the z-dimension is the thickness of the tomogram, which should be the z-dimension of the reconstructed tomogram used for particle picking."
